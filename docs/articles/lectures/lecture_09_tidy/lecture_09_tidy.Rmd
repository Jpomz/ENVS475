# Data table formats  

* Same data, different formats  

```{r}
head(table2)

table3
```

---
# Tidy data  

1) Each variable is a column  

  + Each column is a variable  

2) Each Observation is a row    

  + Each row is an observation  

3) Each value is a cell  

  + Each cell is a value

# Tidy data - Visual  

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/tidy-1.png")
```

---
# Fix `table2`  

* What should the columns be?  

* What should the rows be?  

* What should the values be?  

```{r}
head(table2)
```
* Make a tidy table of the data for Afghanistan in your notes  

---
# Fix `table3`  

* What should the columns be?  

* What should the rows be?  

* What should the values be?  

```{r}
table3
```
* Make a tidy table of the data for Afghanistan in your notes  

---
# Tidy data for Afghanistan  

```{r}
names(table1)
```

* In R, you can run `table1` to see what the tidy version looks like

---
# Uniformity of tidy data  

* Both `table2` and `table3` get modified in different ways  
* End up in same, tidy format

# Why use tidy data  

* There are two main advantages:  

1. One consistent way of storing data.  
  * Easier to learn the tools  
  * Underlying uniformity  
  
2. Specific advantage to placing variables in columns  
  * Allows R’s vectorized nature to shine.  
  * most built-in R functions work with vectors of values.   
  * That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

* `tidyverse`  
  * Designed to work with tidy data. 
  
* Following shows a few small examples showing how you might work with `table1`.  

---
# Working with `table1`, tidy data  

* Compute the TB rate per 1,000 individuals  

```{r, echo=TRUE}
table1 |>
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

---
# Working with `table1`, tidy data  

* Compute total cases per year    

```{r, echo=TRUE}
table1 |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarize(total_cases = sum(cases))
```

---
# Working with `table1`, tidy data  

* Plot changes through time      
* code:  
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(table1, aes(x = year,
                   y = cases,
                   color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2000)) 
```
* output on next slide  

---
# Working with `table1`, tidy data  

```{r, fig.width=10}
ggplot(table1, aes(x = year,
                   y = cases,
                   color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2000)) 
```

---
# Practice problem: Working with different formats    

#### How would you calculate rate for `table2` and for `table3`?  

You would need to perform 4 operations: 
  1. Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.  
  2. Extract the matching population per country per year.  
  3. Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.  
  4. Store back in the appropriate place.  
  
Sketch out how to do this in your notes.

# `tidyr`  

* We won't learn how to tidy data in R   
* That is what the `tidyr` package was made for.  
  * See more at [R4DS-Tidy Data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#introduction)  
  

---
# Entering tidy data  

* When possible, it is always best to enter data in a tidy format from the beginning  
* Sometimes not possible  
  * Field sheets might not be easy to make a tidy format  
  * Automatic sensor data may not be tidy  
  
* May need to re-enter data in a tidy format  

---
# Enter untidy field data  

* Two sheets of field data  
* make a tidy csv to store:  
  * site and physicochemical data  
  * stop at "water samples..." section
