# Overview

This week, we will discuss "tidy" data and how to enter data into spreadsheet software in a tidy format. This will help you get your own data into R in the future.   

# What is tidy data?

1) Each variable is a column; Each column is a variable  

2) Each Observation is a row; Each row is an observation  

3) Each value is a cell; Each cell is a value    

Figure 1 shows these rules visually.  
```{r}
#| label: fig-tidy-structure
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: | 
#|   Figure 1. The following three rules make a dataset tidy: variables are columns,
#|   observations are rows, and values are cells. Fig from [R4DS (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy), [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/)

# Why use tidy data  

1. One consistent way of storing data.  
  * Easier to learn the tools  
  * Underlying uniformity  
  
2. Specific advantage to placing variables in columns  
  * Allows Râ€™s vectorized nature to shine.  
  * most built-in R functions work with vectors of values.   
  * That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

* `tidyverse`  
  * Designed to work with tidy data. 
  
# Working with Tidy data

* `table1` is a small, tidy version of Tuberculosis infection data through time and by country.  
* It is automatically loaded with the `tidyverse`  

```{r}
table1
```

* Every column is one variable, and every variable is one column  
  * country, year, cases, population  
* Every row is one observation.  
  * row 1 is the observation of TB cases and total population for Afghanistan in 1999, etc.  
* Every cell is a single value.  

* Consistent data set up  
* Takes advantage of R's vectorized functions  

* Calculate the infection rate per 1000 people: 
```{r}
table1 |>
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

* It also allows for easy grouping  
* What is the total TB-infection numbers per year?  
```{r}
table1 |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarize(total_cases = sum(cases))
```

* And we can easily plug this into `ggplot`  
* Map aesthetics to variables.  
  * i.e., `color = country`  

```{r}
ggplot(table1, aes(x = year,
                   y = cases,
                   color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2000)) 
```


# Long and Wide data  

* Data can be described as long (lots or rows)  
* or wide (lots of columns)  

* Generally, tidy data is "long", but not always.  
* The `tidyr` package (part of the `tidyverse`) is made to make data tidy  
* `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` are the two primary functions  

* A full examination of `tidyr` is outside the scope of this course  
  * but if you're interested, consider taking my intro to R course in the fall semester.  

# Untidy example  
## Long data, one column has many variables in it  

* `table2` has the same data as `table1` but it is in a long format  

```{r}
table2
```

* The problem here is that the `type` column actually has two variables in it:  
  * `cases` and `population`  
  
* To fix this data, we need to make two new columns called `cases` and `population`  
* We would remove the `count` column, and move the values into the appropriate new columns.  

* Here is an example of what the first two rows would look like.  

```{r}
tibble(country = "Afghanistan",
       year = 1999,
       cases = c(745, 2666),
       population = c(19987071, 20595360))
```


## Variables in column names  

* Another common problem is that the columns have multiple variables in the names.  
* let's look at a subset of the `who2` data  
  * `who2` is also a part of the `tidyverse`  
  * The `who2` has TB data reported by country and year  
  * the column names has information on the:  
    * Test type, i.e., `sp`, `sn`, `ep`  
    * Patient sex: `m` or `f`  
    * Patient age range  `014`, `1524`..., `65`  


```{r}
who2 |>
  select(country:sp_m_1524, sn_f_5564:sn_f_65) |>
  head()
```

* This is a wide data format  
* In this example, the `who2` data has `r ncol(who2) - 2` columns which could be presented in 3 columns (test type, sex, age range) and many more rows  
* In other words, this data needs to be transformed into a long format.  

### Your assignment will be to work on tidying a smaller version of this data  

## This concludes the lab  
You should now begin your homework assignment
